# NCAA-Track-Field-Graphs

In the year 2020 several new models of running spikes released which featured new technologies and 
improvements upon existing technologies. Due to the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 outbreak,
many runners did not have the opportunity to compete in the 2020 track and field or cross country seasons.
Come the indoor and outdoor 2021 seasons, the NCAA Division I saw many record breaking performances.

Some people have speculated that these "super-shoes" are directly responsible for these improved performances.
Others have noted special circumstances. The NCAA allowed athletes to compete an additional season outside of 
the normal eligibility period. This led to an influx of 5th and 6th years returning who would not have otherwise.
Since there was no 2020 season, athletes had the opportunity to devote more time to training and improvement.
Initially, the regional qualifying fields were reduced to 32 people per event, down from 48. This increased pressure
on top performers to notch a good time. 

In the 100m, 200m, 400m, and 800m the performances this year were roughly uneffected. 
It is typical for times to drop slightly year to year as materials and equipment advance and training becomes smarter.
But, the 1500, 5000m, and 10000m show a clear outlier. 2021 is clearly better than any prior year. There are more people running much faster. 
These graphs corroborate to show consistent improvements of approximately 2-5 seconds. The new Nike Dragonfly
spikes are advertisted as intended for the 1500m-10000m, so these performances could possibly be attributed 
directly to the spikes.
